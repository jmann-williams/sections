## Optional challenges

*These challenges are here if you’d like to try a little more work—they are for extra experience and learning. They are completely optional and not graded. Show them to me if you’d like—I’d love to see them.*

1. Add second section row with two images and some text, following this layout:

    ```
    [ image ]  text  [ image ]
    ```

2. Add a third section row with one image and text, but reverse order to the first row; follow this layout:

    ```
    text  [ image ]
    ```
